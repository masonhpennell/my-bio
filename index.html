        <p class="lead">My name is Mason Pennell. I am a freshman at Cal State Long Beach and am in the Computer Science Program. I have always had an interest in computers and technology as a whole ever since I started playing video games.
        I want to succeed in this course, as well as other CECS courses so I can eventually work at a company like Blizzard and work on upcoming projects. In my free time, I like to play video games, watch YouTube, exercise, and read books.
        Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead.
        Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming, ged to the rules and I hit the ground running. Didn't make sense not to live for fun, your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.</div>
